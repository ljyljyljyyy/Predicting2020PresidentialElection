## A Logistic Regression with Random Intercepts Modelling of 2020 USA Federal Election

The purpose of this study is to predict the popular vote outcome of the 2020 American federal election. We used R (R Core Team, 2019) with lme4 (Bates et al.,2015) to construct a logistic regression with random intercepts model using Democracy Fund and UCLA Nationscape survey data (Tausanovitch et al., 2020). In our model, the outcome of vote for Trump or not is constructed as a binary outcome which is modeled by both individual and group leveled predictors “agegroup”, “sex”, “race”, “region” and “education”. We select a logistic regression with random intercepts model to effectively analyze the log odds of the binary outcome variable as a linear combination of the predictor variables to account for both fixed and random effects from individual and group-leveled data. A post-stratification technique is employed to adjust the weights of the survey sample based on 2018 IPSUMS USA Census data, so that nonresponse and underrepresented groups in the population are accounted (Ruggles et al., 2020). Datasets are not uploaded due to legal concerns. Please contact jiayuan.liu@mail.utoronto.ca for dataset access.
